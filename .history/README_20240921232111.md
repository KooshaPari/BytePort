Project Architecture

Overview

The BytePort platform will follow a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

Components

	1.	Frontend (SvelteKit):
	•	Handles user interactions and presents data fetched from the backend.
	•	Implements routing, state management, and UI components.
	•	Communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.
	2.	Backend (Loco.rs):
	•	Exposes RESTful API endpoints for the frontend to consume.
	•	Manages business logic, data processing, and communication with the database.
	•	Interfaces with virtualization tools to manage VMs.
	3.	Database:
	•	Stores user data, VM configurations, and operational logs.
	•	Ensures data integrity and supports transactions.
	4.	Virtualization Layer:
	•	Uses tools like Firecracker to run and manage microVMs.
	•	Provides APIs or command-line interfaces for VM operations.

Data Flow

	•	User Interaction: Users interact with the frontend application.
	•	API Requests: Frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend API.
	•	Business Logic: Backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and virtualization tools.
	•	Response: Backend sends responses back to the frontend, which updates the UI accordingly.

Development Phases and Timeline

	•	Optimize application performance (caching, query optimization).
	•	Conduct security audits and penetration testing.

Phase 7: Documentation and Finalization (Week 9)

	•	Write comprehensive documentation (API docs, user guides).
	•	Prepare deployment scripts and environment configurations.
	•	Conduct a final review and make necessary adjustments.

Implementation Details

7.1 Backend Implementation

	•	Routing and Controllers:
	•	Define routes for all API endpoints using Loco.rs’ routing mechanisms.
	•	Implement controllers to handle requests and responses.
	•	Authentication Middleware:
	•	Use JWT for stateless authentication.
	•	Implement middleware to protect routes and verify tokens.
	•	Database Models and ORM:
	•	Define data models for users, VMs, and logs.
	•	Use SQLx or Diesel for type-safe database interactions.
	•	Integration with Virtualization Tools:
	•	Use Rust bindings or execute shell commands to interact with Firecracker/QEMU.
	•	Implement abstraction layers to allow easy swapping of virtualization tools if needed.

7.2 Frontend Implementation

	•	Routing:
	•	Use SvelteKit’s file-based routing for pages (e.g., /dashboard, /login).
	•	State Management:
	•	Utilize Svelte stores to manage global state (user authentication status, VM list).
	•	UI Components:
	•	Create reusable components (e.g., buttons, forms, modals).
	•	Use a UI library or framework for styling (e.g., Tailwind CSS).
	•	API Integration:
	•	Create a service layer to handle API calls.
	•	Implement error handling and loading states.
	•	Authentication Flow:
	•	Implement login and registration forms.
	•	Store JWT tokens securely (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies).

Deployment Strategy

Backend Deployment

	•	Containerization:
	•	Build a Docker image for the backend application.
	•	Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
