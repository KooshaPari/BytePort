## Introduction

This manifesto outlines the development of **BytePort**, a cloud-based platform for deploying and managing applications using a custom-developed MicroVM technology called **NanoVMS**. The project leverages **SvelteKit** for the frontend and **Loco.rs** for the backend. BytePort aims to provide a Docker-like experience for deploying applications but uses lightweight virtual machines instead of containers, offering users greater control and isolation.

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** BytePort - MicroVM Cloud Management and Portfolio Integration

**MicroVM Technology Name:** NanoVMS

**Description:**

BytePort is a cloud solution for deploying web applications and other projects directly from Git repositories. It creates and deploys pre-configured MicroVMs based on user specifications using the custom-developed **NanoVMS** technology. Upon successful deployment, BytePort integrates the project into the user's portfolio (e.g., `kooshapari.com`), adding project pages and linking the frontend of each web app to its respective project. Non-web app projects can also be deployed with custom configurations. Clients can view, debug, clone, and rebuild these instances as needed.
